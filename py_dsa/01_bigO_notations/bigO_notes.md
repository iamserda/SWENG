# Notes on Big O Notations

What is BigO Notation?

A way of comparing code based on their efficiency.

What is "Time Complexity?"
How our code behaves relative to cycles of work, speed, as the number of inputs grows?

- Does it get slower?
- Does stay the same?

What is "Space Complexity?"
How much memory does our solution requires as the number of inputs increases?

- Does the space remain the same.
- Does it increase? How fast? Linear, Exponential, Constant?

Notations:
Omega: "Best" case, or result for a given solution.
Theta: "Average" case.
Omicron: "Worst" case, the least efficient case for a solution. This is important because it may occur. And a business may need to know this information.

For example, at a steady 65mph, a car can drive 65 miles within 60 mins. The town's average is around 72 minutes. The worst, let's say the express way is busy, 1.5hrs. 60 is omega, 72min is theta.
